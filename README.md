# cifar-10-dataset-classification

#### Assignment Statement:
In this assignment, you will train a multi-classification model on a dataset of images using the
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The dataset that you will use is the CIFAR-10
dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per
class. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify each image into one of the 10
classes.
